# react-portfolio

This single page, conditionally rendered website was built with the React JS library and a Bootstrap CSS style foundation.

[Click this link](https://joejhansen.github.io/react-portfolio/) to be redirected to the site.

Coolors was a big help in coming up with the themes and React made it relatively simple to conditionally render and save preferences.

I intend to keep this updated for the forseeable future or at least until some newer, shinier library catches my eye.
